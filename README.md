#### A Companion App for Frontier Developments' Elite Dangerous (game)

This app allows you to input the sector-relative coordinates of any star and get back a letter code name that the procedural engine will have used for that location. It will also show you other nearby sector names.

Alternatively you can enter the in-game name of any procedurally-generated star system (with auto-complete) and the system will show you the nearby systems and also the sector-relative coordates.

In "Goldiloxmode" you can put in the temperature and radius of a star, and the app will display the habitable zone range for the star. Use the sliders to set the values; hold your finger still and your phone will vibrate slightly (assuming you're on a compatible device on iOS 10 and you have turned on System > Sound > System Haptics). You can also use the < > buttons to make small adjustments to the figures. Along the bottom row are the different spectral classes of star; this selection sets the range used in the sliders. 

Enjoy!
